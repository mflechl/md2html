\sqrt{a+b}

```math
\sqrt{ 2 p_{T,1} {\rm MET} (1-{\rm cos}(\Delta \phi_1)) +  
2 p_{T,2} {\rm MET} (1-{\rm cos}(\Delta \phi_2)) +
2 p_{T,1} p_{T,2} (1-{\rm cos}(\Delta \phi_{12})) }
```

where $`\Delta \phi_1`$, $`\Delta \phi_2`$, and $`\Delta \phi_{12}`$ are the differences in azimuth between the first leg and the MET, the second leg and the MET, and the two legs, respectively.
